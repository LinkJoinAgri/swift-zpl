/// The ^BQ command produces a matrix symbology consisting of an array of nominally square modules arranged in an overall square pattern. 
/// A unique pattern at three of the symbolâ€™s four corners assists in determining bar code size, position, and inclination.
///
/// **QR Code Bar Code**
///
/// A wide range of symbol sizes is possible, along with four levels of error correction. 
/// User-specified module dimensions provide a wide variety of symbol production techniques.
///
/// QR Code Model 1 is the original specification, while QR Code Model 2 is an enhanced form of the symbology.
/// Model 2 provides additional features and can be automatically differentiated from Model 1.
///
/// Model 2 is the recommended model and should normally be used.
///
/// This bar code is printed using field data specified in a subsequent ^FD string.
///
/// Encodable character sets include numeric data, alphanumeric data, 8-bit byte data, and Kanji characters.
